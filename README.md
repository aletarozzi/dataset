The following dataset is structured as (d, PL, category), where d represents the 3D distance between the transmitter and receiver, PL is the path loss obtained on the receiver side, and category indicates the line-of-sight (LoS) or non-LoS (NLoS) condition between the base station (BS) and receiver.  In this context, receivers are considered to be automated guided vehicles (AGVs) or machine nodes (MNs), which are located on the machines. In particular, category=1 is assigned to cases of LoS and category=0 to NLoS conditions. The following dataset was generated through the simulation of an industrial environment at various frequencies, including 3.5, 60, and 300 GHz, utilising the 3DScat ray-tracing tool, developed at the University of Bologna. Specifically, the path loss at 300 GHz takes into consideration also additional attenuations due to molecular absorbtion.
