The following dataset is structured as (d, PL, category), where d represents the 3D distance between the transmitter and receiver, PL is the path loss obtained on the receiver side, and category indicates the line-of-sight (LoS) or non-LoS (NLoS) condition between the base station (BS) and receiver. In particular category =1 for LoS and category =0 for NLoS cases. The following dataset was generated through the simulation of an industrial environment at various frequencies, including 3.5, 60, and 300 GHz, utilising the 3DScat ray-tracing tool, developed at the University of Bologna.
